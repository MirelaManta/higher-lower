# "Guess the followers count" game
It's a cool little game where you have to guess which social media account has a higher number of followers.  
As long as your guess is correct, the game will go on and it's going to keep track of your score.  
In each round the second account will become the first account to be compared with another.  
This project was a nice oppotunity to practise defining functions, working with dictionaries and loops.
